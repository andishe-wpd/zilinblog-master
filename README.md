=========

This is a frontend project built with React using TypeScript. This project is fully responsive and follows best practices, utilizing modern tools and libraries such as ESLint for code linting, Atomic Design for component organization, Yarn as the package manager, Vite as the build tool, and Figma for design collaboration. The project is also optimized using memoization and callback functions to improve performance.

The tech stack includes:

*   React
*   React Query
*   Vite
*   TypeScript
*   Zustand
*   Tailwind
*   MSW (Mock Service Worker)

The project is deployed on Netlify, you can access the live version at [https://super-pasca-9d987f.netlify.app/](https://super-pasca-9d987f.netlify.app/)

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v14 or higher): Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Development
-----------

To start the development server, run the following command:

Copy code

`yarn dev`

This will launch the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view it.

Building the Project
--------------------

To build a production-ready version of the application, run the following command:

Copy code

`yarn build`

This will generate an optimized build in the dist directory.

Linting
-------

This project utilizes ESLint for code linting. Here is the configuration used:

javascriptCopy code

`module.exports = {   env: { browser: true, es2020: true },   extends: [     'eslint:recommended',     'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',     'plugin:react-hooks/recommended',   ],   parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',   parserOptions: { ecmaVersion: 'latest', sourceType: 'module' },   plugins: ['react-refresh'],   rules: {     'react-refresh/only-export-components': 'warn',   }, }`

To run the linter, use the following command:

Copy code

`yarn lint`

Prettier
--------

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. Here is the configuration used:

jsonCopy code

`{   "singleQuote": true,   "semi": false,   "trailingComma": "all",   "arrowParens": "avoid",   "overrides": [     {       "files": "*.tsx",       "options": {         "parser": "typescript"       }     }   ] }`

Atomic Design
-------------

The project follows the Atomic Design methodology for component organization. The components are structured into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, providing a scalable and maintainable architecture.

Design Collaboration
--------------------

We use Figma for design collaboration. Access the Figma project at \[link to Figma project\] to view and collaborate on the designs.

Branching and Commit Strategy
-----------------------------

For each task or feature, create a new branch based on the master branch. Ensure that the branch name is descriptive of the task or feature being worked on. Once the task is completed, create a pull request for code review and merging it back into the master branch.

We follow an atomic commit strategy, which involves breaking down changes into small, self-contained units of work. Each commit represents a single logical change or feature.

Folder Structure and Architecture
---------------------------------

The project follows a modular and scalable folder structure to organize the codebase effectively. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

*   **assets**: Contains static assets used in the application (e.g., icons, pictures).
*   **components**: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
    *   **button**, **link**, **login**, **modal**, **postcard**, **search**, **input**, **utils**
    *   **layout**: Contains the layout components.
        *   **breadcrumb**, **header**, **footer**
    *   **lazyLoadImage**: A component for lazy loading images.
*   **constants**: Contains application-wide constants.
*   **interfaces**: Contains types and interfaces for TypeScript.
*   **hooks**: Contains React Query fetching and custom hooks.
*   **mocks**: Contains handlers for the Mock Service Worker (MSW).
*   **pages**: Contains the page-level components that represent different views of the application.
*   **router**: Contains the React Router setup.
*   **store**: Contains the Zustand state management setup.

This folder structure helps to keep the codebase organized, promotes reusability, and makes it easier to navigate and maintain the project as it grows.

MSW (Mock Service Worker)
-------------------------

This project uses MSW for mocking backend responses, providing an interface to test under various scenarios without the need for an actual backend.

Here is an example configuration:

javascriptCopy code

`export const handlers = [   rest.get('http://localhost:3000/api/posts', (req, res, ctx) => {     // handler logic   }),   rest.post('http://localhost:3000/api/login', (req, res, ctx) => {     // handler logic   }),   rest.get('http://localhost:3000/api/user', (req, res, ctx) => {     // handler logic   }), ]`

This config includes handlers for fetching posts and user data, and for simulating the authentication process.

VS Code Extensions
------------------

To enhance your development experience and maintain consistent coding standards, this project includes a set of recommended Visual Studio Code extensions. The extensions listed below are configured in the `.vscode` folder of this project:

*   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
*   [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
*   [Styled Components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components)
*   [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

These extensions provide essential functionalities for linting, code formatting, React Native development, debugging, auto-importing modules, styling components, and Git integration.
